Thank you to everyone, for taking time out of your lives to watch me graduate from California State University, Sacramento. After an embarisingly long 3 years and 8 months (i know, i know... it's not a race), I have earned a Batchelor of Science degree in Computer Science. I have also earned 2 certificates: a certificate in Information Assurance and Security, and a certificate in Cyber Defense and Operations. This accomplishment required a lot out of me, but it was made just a little bit easier by all of you. I hope your seats are comfy, and that your journey here was straightforward and stress-free. If not, hopefully the wonderful food, drink, and dessert we will have afterword will make up for some of it. Thank you for being here! Your presence seriously makes this day special to me.

# Grandma
You have provided me with memories of amazing vacations, Christmases, and the occational stay at "grandma and grandpa's house". Each time I reminise, I always feel a warmpth in my chest, and a silly smile can't help but show up. Not every grandparent would be so consistant and caring like you always are. I'm not sure a Christmas or birthday has ever passed where I didn't get a loving call from you. No matter how busy everyone's lives get, you always put the effort to reach out and stay connected, or at least ask for details from other people so you know what everyone is doing. Thank you for taking interest in my life, celebrating this accomplishment with me, and above all, being a terrific grandma. You are a peice of this family that helps glue everyone together. I love you grandma!

Harrison! You have changed roles SO many times in my head. From a screaming baby, to a goofball who had the silliest catch-phrases, to a mini-me, and now, a mature and independant young man! I want to take a minute and thank you for being such a cool person. I realize that you don't have to message me on Discord, play Minecraft with me and my friends, or even desire to be a part of my life. But you do, because you want to. You want to be involved in the crazyness that is my life, even if there are one and a half decades, and 2,500 miles between us. I notice that you often explore all the interests I am in, and you look for my footprints to mark your own path. To be honest, I find it confusing because I think to myself "Why follow in MY footsteps? I'm just barely figuring out how to do this whole 'living' thing at 29. You could do so much better by going ANY other direction." But I need to take a step back and realize that you are doing these things because you WANT to. So thank you. I hope I continue to make the choices that you feel are worthy to recreate. And please, whenever you find out my mistakes, do your best to learn from them, and don't recreate them. (Or just don't get caught) ;-P     I love you Harrison!

Collin

This is to Collin. Not Mark. No adjective or single phrase exclamation could accurately preface how much you mean to me, so I won't even start with one. We have known eachother forever. Counting the years doesn't even make sense anymore. You have helped me tremendously in getting me to this spot in my life. You certainly helped me academically... You gave me the points I 'earned' on those spelling tests decades ago. You helped me with countless hours of much-needed distraction and recharge from constant schoolwork. You helped me emotionally, when my mental health was spiraling and my ability to discern logic from feeling was nonexcistant. You helped me with personal safety and shelter, when I couldn't handle it on my own. You have helped me define a proper standard for what a respectable, accomplished peer looks like, and someone I should strive to one-up. You are someone who is directly tied to my accomplishments, wether you realize it or not. There are so many life paths that would have lead to a derastically different place than where I am today, if it wasn't for who you are as a person, and how important you have become to me. And you continue to nudge me into directions that can only lead to a more successful and happy life. You mean SO much to me, and deserve way more recognition for the things you have done than what can be shared here. From my entire heart and soul, thank you Collin. I love you dude.

Juanita!

First of all, thank you SO much for taking the graduation pictues. Dang they are georgeous. I appretiate having a fellow university student to gossip with about terrible administration and terrible professors. It's crazy how your struggles match my own regardless of the different campus. I think we would have had a great time being roomates or neighbors and stufying together. Even when we aren't in study-mode, I have a great time with you. You have

Felicity.

Although I don't think I have done enough to be considered an older brother, I certainly see you as a little sister. But also a peer, and a good friend? Despite the differences in age, distance, and life, I find it so refreshing to just chat with you about all things philosophical. You and I have shared similar chalanges in life, and as a result, have such an easy time checking-in with eachother and just getting to the deep and meaningful stuff without any kind of apprehention. I appreciate how often you look through people and their dismissive responses of "I'm tired", and how fast you swing back with "Okay, but how are you really?" You have helped me get here because of your emotional support, and your desire to put care and interest into my life and well-being. The trust and value you have put into my opinions and suggestions make me feel validated, and have made it feel like my ideas and past situations mean something. And every time I have been absolutely ded from school overload, and seek refuge in your part of California, the vibe you bring to every gathering is exactly what I need. The energy, the conversations, the opinions and conflics, it's all the perfect amount of stimulus that completly distracts me from the stress this place has caused me. Thank you for being here and celebrating with me.

Max Max Max!

Thank you for being here. I love it when you are involved in things like this, and I want to see you more often! You are a super chill dude, and I like how effortlessly I can just be around you and chat and pass the time away. You are an individual who seems to really focus on the needs of others, and I appreciate all the unconditional care you have given not only to me, but everyone in our mutual family. You are the one who is quick to improve any vibe, with a joke, a pun, or just genuine affection and sillyness. I certainly took advantage of the hours we gamed together, where you still have a habit of putting the needs of others first. ;)   You helped me recharge and destress over these difficult semesters, and getting to this point in my life definitely would have been harder without you. Thank you for being an awesome person, and making an impact in my life.

Julie! I can't beleive how fortunate I was to be able to meet you, and become such close friends. There so many life events that had to line up just perfectly for it all to happen, and I'm so glad this was the result. You have helped me stay sane, entertained, and happy during the hours that noone else was available for. Although your sleep schedule is much more healthy and appropriate now, I thuroughly enjoyed the midnight to 3:30 am conversations we had. We communicate so effortlessly, and both enjoy debating everything from the most mundane topics, to the deepest and life-defining. You absolutely helped me by being the late-night, and sometimes midday, sanity checker that I could trust with any kind of question, no matter how vulnerable. It means so much to me, to be able to engage in mentally stimulating and devicive topics, in such a neutral and exploratory way. It truely is rare to find someone like you, and because of this, you are a treasure to me. I'm glad you're here today to celebrate with me, because family should come together to congradulate accomplishments, and you are 100%, without a doubt, a member of my family. I love you Julie!

Mo!!! Congratulations, 2024 alumni! Woo!!!! We did it!!! Thank you for being a real one. You are the EXACT kind of person I wanted to surround myself with in my college experiance. Free-spirited, confident, a real stand-your-ground kind of person, who also is SO down to be involved in good times, and bad times. You trust people openly, wear your heart on your sleave, and express yourself when you want to, how you want to, %&@# what everyone else thinks. Seriously, you ROCK. I loved every single time we were involved in the same things, and I'm so happy that we were in the same group semester after semester. You have taught me to be a lot more socially aware, and that great connections can be made when everyone is just a litte bit more vulnerable and open. You might have also taught me that I don't know how to deal with finalities. I can't comprehend how this might be one of the last times we share the same space. I'm certainly not ready for it, and I'm doing by best to not even aknowledge it. Please, stay in touch? And if you're planning on staying in the Sacramento area, you BETTER keep joining in on the dinners. Thank you for impacting my life so much.

Abigayle!  You are special to me. The time we spent in group feels so much longer than it actually has been. You have put forth so much effort to be a friend, a familiar face, a regular count-me-in kind of person, and as a result, you've become part of my CSUS family that I'm scared to leave. You have always cared about all of us from day 1, and you have personally trusted and taken an interest in my life that I hope you feel is recipricated. Your honesty, welcoming nature, and openness is something that won't be forgotten, and it's something I honestly look forward to every Friday. I hope the future semesters continue being blessed by your presnce.
