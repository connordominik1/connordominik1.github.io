# THANK YOU!

Thank you to everyone, for taking time out of your lives to watch me graduate from California State University, Sacramento. After an embarrassingly long 3 years and 8 months (i know, i know... it's not a race), I have earned a Batchelor of Science degree in Computer Science. I have also earned 2 certificates: a certificate in Information Assurance and Security, and a certificate in Cyber Defense and Operations. This accomplishment required a lot out of me, but it was made just a little bit easier by all of you. I hope your seats are comfy, and that your journey here was straightforward and stress-free. If not, hopefully the wonderful food, drink, and dessert we will have afterword will make up for some of it. Thank you for being here! Your presence seriously makes this day special to me.

I would like to recognize some people who have helped me arrive here, and remind each and every one of you that you are significant to me, in heart and in support.

# Grandma
![grandma](https://github.com/connordominik1/connordominik1.github.io/assets/114826469/d470e451-3bf1-4f54-8d0e-6e6e007728c0)

Grandma!

You have provided me with memories of amazing vacations, Christmases, and the occasional stay at "grandma and grandpa's house". Each time I reminisce, I always feel a warmth in my chest, and a silly smile can't help but show up. Not every grandparent would be so consistent and caring like you always are. I'm not sure a Christmas or birthday has ever passed where I didn't get a loving call from you. No matter how busy everyone's lives get, you always put the effort to reach out and stay connected, or at least ask for details from other people so you know what everyone is doing. Thank you for taking interest in my life, celebrating this accomplishment with me, and above all, being a terrific grandma. You are a piece of this family that helps glue everyone together. I love you grandma!

# Mom

Mom

How could I ever produce enough words to adequately express how much you have enabled my accomplishments? You're my mom! None of this could have happened without your support. What you have done for me goes well beyond what could be expected of a great mom. You have been a friend who supports every aspect of life, from financial to emotional, from spiritual to philosophical, from shelter to encouragement. The years in which I earned this degree were the hardest years of my life, and at every step, you were concerned with how you could maximize the support you gave. There were many times where I needed sound advice, answers to life's big questions, intensive care due to sickness, and even physical rehab due to a leg fracture. At every point in my life, the only way I was to receive less care was if I explicitly asked for it. The default was an incredible amount of care, and you deserve recognition for it. There was never a question of where I would go or who to turn to for help. You would always do everything you could, and I felt so safe and fortunate because of it. You win the award for being the #1 supporter, by a landslide. There's absolute certainty that I wouldn't be earning this degree if it wasn't for you. You always encouraged me, and helped facilitate my pursuit of higher education. I could not, and would not have done all of this without you. Thank you, mom. For everything. I love you SO SO SO much.

# Doran
![doran](https://github.com/connordominik1/connordominik1.github.io/assets/114826469/5549bac5-2cff-42fa-9722-09f9708da730)

Doran.

You came into my life 100% ready to take on the extra responsibility that it took in supporting a little one. I remember the midnight bathroom wake-ups, so I would stop wetting the bed. I remember the early morning escorts to the shower, because there was no way I would get out of that bed if I could get away with it. I remember the drives to school, where I was in charge of moving the stick shift into the right gear. Do you realize how hard it is to go from 3rd to 4th, and NOT 2nd? I remember a sleepy Doran, and a zoned-out Connor arriving at 'school', only to realize that we are at your work, miles and miles in the opposite direction. And more recently, I remember the countless times I was in a bind with car troubles, and how you would quite literally drop everything, and not rest it was all sorted out. And don't you dare think "That's what we do, we are family." No. That's taking way too much impact out of what you do. At night, in the middle of a rain storm, I purposefully drifted around numerous corners. One corner, I didn't drift the way I was intending, and smacked into a traffic island. Wheels, axils, engine, subframe; everything, bent 6 inches to the right. Not a single word was expressed in a loud voice. We limped that car back into the driveway, and within a weekend, the car had a new front end transplanted on it. Then I ripped my bumper off by rubbing against a turning tree-trimming truck. Fixed in a day. This month, my alternator died. I had a replacement car within an hour, and it was fixed before I could even give a second thought to it. Family doesn't just 'do' these things Doran. YOU do. Because you're amazing. The amount of support I had in my life from the moment you entered it, till now and supposedly beyond, is incredible. You have helped me an uncountable amount of times, have enabled me to achieve this degree, and so SO much more. You can't understand just how much all of that means to me, and why I feel so driven to somehow pay all of this back. You are wonderful, selfless, humble, and a massive part of my life. Thank you for all of this, and please share in some of the celebration with me. Because after all, you very much contributed to all of this. I love you Doran.

# Zach
![zach](https://github.com/connordominik1/connordominik1.github.io/assets/114826469/c8652867-a7a9-4ca1-9ef1-0f625b612b06)

Zach

What is there to say, other than you're THE big brother? The majority of the finer challenges in Connor's young educational career were down to you. You packed my lunches. You made sure I woke up, and eventually got in the shower. You checked if my toothbrush was wet, and probably so many other things that I just took for granted. You probably made sure all my books were in my backpack, and that my shoes were by the door. I never questioned how all the mornings flowed so smoothly, and a minute of pause should be spent recognizing the help you gave. But the assistance didn't stop there. Growing up, I learned a ton from you: what one could get away with, and what buttons you just don't push with authority. I learned what the most indestructible K'nex battering ram looked like, and which legos I wasn't allowed to touch. I learned that breaking trust is never worth it, and that information told to you in private is not your information to spread. All of these little life lessons have culminated into massive character strengths. Sure, these are things that a big brother is 'supposed' to do, but it's more than that. A big brother isn't expected to share his friends' Minecraft server with him. A big brother isn't expected to share insecurities, divulge major character desires, and future ambition. You even took me skydiving, and joined me for core-memory-generating solar eclipse. You're not just a big brother. You're Zach. You are the definition of selfless, and it's incredible that you have chosen to be a part of my life. Sure, you told on me, and got me in trouble way too many times; but damn, my world would have been so much worse if you didn't do exactly what you did. Thank you for everything, and thank you especially for being here and celebrating with me. I love you Zach, so much more than you know.

Papa

You have been a major support in my entire life, and esspecially in my pursuit of higher education. It was always one of the major pushes: get to the Scout rank of 'Eagle Scout', and get a degree. Perhaps this was already fulfilled with my associates degree? Well oops! I have a batchelors now too! Throughout my education, it was important for all of your kids to seek improvement. I vividly remember my struggles in elemntary school, spending hours and hours at the kitchen table, struggling with math assignments. It was tough. I also remember hearing about the parents of my classmates, who would ground their children if they ever brought home a 'B'. My situation was different. Instead of using punishment and fear tacktics to 'scare' children into performing better, you offered a reward. If I could bring home straight C's, I would get a crisp $100. And oh boy, was that one of the hardest things I ever worked for at that age. But it worked. I finally performed at a level most people would consider 'barely passing'. All of this is to say that you were a major contributer of academic challaenege in my life. The D's meant that I had to try harder, and the B's could become A's, as long as I tried harder. The finish line was never the final goal, as a high school deploma was quickly followed by enrollment at a community college, and today, I have earned this batchelors. I doubt I would have done so if it wasn't for you. So, thank you for the pushes that helped me discover what my limits are, and which ones can be overcome. I love you, Papa.

Harrison!

You have changed roles SO many times in my head. From a screaming baby, to a goofball who had the silliest catch-phrases, to a mini-me, and now, a mature and independent young man! I want to take a minute and thank you for being such a cool person. I realize that you don't have to message me on Discord, play Minecraft with me and my friends, or even desire to be a part of my life. But you do, because you want to. You want to be involved in the craziness that is my life, even if there are one and a half decades, and 2,500 miles between us. I notice that you often explore all the interests I am in, and you look for my footprints to mark your own path. To be honest, I find it confusing because I think to myself "Why follow in MY footsteps? I'm just barely figuring out how to do this whole 'living' thing at 29. You could do so much better by going ANY other direction." But I need to take a step back and realize that you are doing these things because you WANT to. So, thank you. I hope I continue to make the choices that you feel are worthy to recreate. And please, whenever you find out my mistakes, do your best to learn from them, and don't recreate them. (Or just don't get caught) ;-P     I love you, Harrison!

Lauren!

Whatie? You're here?? But I'm a fartie, so you didn't have to be! ;-D  How's it hanging sista? Thank you for being such an awesome little sis. I want you to know I still have all of the artwork you have given me. Even the wrapping paper you customized. In fact, I'm holding it right now, as I type this. I won't ever forget all of the silliness and joy you bring wherever you go. My most recent memory is when Zach, Harrison, you, and I wrote that absolutely perfect story. In the story, the mean girls and their powerful duty were absolutely destroying a city. When you are a famous artist, I expect you to recreate that story with pictures on every page. Actually, draw it now! The story needs to be shared with the world. :)   I enjoy having you around Lauren, because you always make any visit into a perfect one. I know you don't have much control over being able to visit me as often as you would like to, so I need to make the effort and come to you more often. I want to see those ice-skating skills, and I want to have all the artwork, and I want to play more VR golf with you. You are special to me, and I'm so happy that you choose to include me in the things you like. <3     I love you, Lauren!

Shannon!

The level of support that came from you was astounding. You were under no social obligation to support my endeavors in higher education, yet you did, and at a level many parents aren't able to. I relied on you for every technical question there was. CSU vs UC, when does GPA matter, how to start applications and make yourself sound like the perfect candidate, budgeting, asking for help from others... You addressed it all. You even taught me what the consequences were for losing patience, and then taking it out on the one who is helping you. You made sure I never sold myself short. Even when I had this crazy ambition of attending Berkely, you were all for it, and helped make that summer semester happen. I'm still astounded at the support you gave, and I keep looking for ways to pay it all back. I know you have told me time and again that you're not looking for, nor willing to accept reimbursement, but I'll keep looking for ways to. Normal people don't do all that just for the sake of maximizing someone’s potential. But I guess that means you're not normal. You're extraordinary, and very special to me. It fills my heart that you're here to witness what kind of potential you helped me achieve. You are a huge part of the team that made this happen, and for that, I am incredibly grateful. Thank you, Shannon, for all of this. I love you!

Collin

This is to Collin. Not Mark. No adjective or single phrase exclamation could accurately preface how much you mean to me, so I won't even start with one. We have known each other forever. Counting the years doesn't even make sense anymore. You have helped me tremendously in getting me to this spot in my life. You certainly helped me academically... You gave me the points I 'earned' on those spelling tests decades ago. You helped me with countless hours of much-needed distraction and recharge from constant schoolwork. You helped me emotionally, when my mental health was spiraling and my ability to discern logic from feeling was nonexistent. You helped me with personal safety and shelter, when I couldn't handle it on my own. You have helped me define a proper standard for what a respectable, accomplished peer looks like, and someone I should strive to one-up. You are someone who is directly tied to my accomplishments, whether you realize it or not. There are so many life paths that would have led to a drastically different place than where I am today, if it wasn't for who you are as a person, and how important you have become to me. And you continue to nudge me into directions that can only lead to a more successful and happy life. You mean SO much to me, and deserve way more recognition for the things you have done than what can be shared here. From my entire heart and soul, thank you Collin. I love you dude.

Juanita!

First of all, thank you SO much for taking the graduation pictures. Dang they are gorgeous. I appreciate having a fellow university student to gossip with about terrible administration and terrible professors. It's crazy how your struggles match my own regardless of the different campuses we attended. I think we would have had a great time being roommates or neighbors and studying together. Even when we aren't in study-mode, I have a great time with you. You plan such grand adventures for the entire group, and each and every has me creating such fond memories. You are the first person I know I can go to if I am in need of an any advice regarding photography, sewing, anything theater, media… really anything having to do with creativity, you already have the solution before the question is asked. The hospitality I enjoy when I am over at your place is remarkable, and the moment I leave is the moment I start hoping for the next visit. Thank you for being such a benefit to my life, and being here to celebrate with me today.

Felicity.

Although I don't think I have done enough to be considered an older brother, I certainly see you as a little sister. But also, a peer, and a good friend? Despite the differences in age, distance, and life, I find it so refreshing to just chat with you about all things philosophical. You and I have shared similar challenges in life, and as a result, have such an easy time checking-in with each other and just getting to the deep and meaningful stuff without any kind of apprehension. I appreciate how often you look through people and their dismissive responses of "I'm tired", and how fast you swing back with "Okay, but how are you really?" You have helped me get here because of your emotional support, and your desire to put care and interest into my life and well-being. The trust and value you have put into my opinions and suggestions make me feel validated, and have made it feel like my ideas and past situations mean something. And every time I have been absolutely ded from school overload, and seek refuge in your part of California, the vibe you bring to every gathering is exactly what I need. The energy, the conversations, the opinions and conflicts, it's all the perfect amount of stimulus that completely distracts me from the stress this place has caused me. Thank you for being here and celebrating with me.

Max Max Max!

Thank you for being here. I love it when you are involved in things like this, and I want to see you more often! You are a super chill dude, and I like how effortlessly I can just be around you and chat and pass the time away. You are an individual who seems to really focus on the needs of others, and I appreciate all the unconditional care you have given not only to me, but everyone in our mutual family. You are the one who is quick to improve any vibe, with a joke, a pun, or just genuine affection and silliness. I certainly took advantage of the hours we gamed together, where you still have a habit of putting the needs of others first. ;)   You helped me recharge and destress over these difficult semesters, and getting to this point in my life definitely would have been harder without you. Thank you for being an awesome person, and making an impact in my life.

Julie!

I can't believe how fortunate I was to be able to meet you, and become such close friends. There so many life events that had to line up just perfectly for it all to happen, and I'm so glad this was the result. You have helped me stay sane, entertained, and happy during the hours that no one else was available for. Although your sleep schedule is much healthier and more appropriate now, I thoroughly enjoyed the midnight to 3:30 am conversations we had. We communicate so effortlessly, and both enjoy debating everything from the most mundane topics, to the deepest and life-defining. You absolutely helped me by being the late-night, and sometimes midday, sanity checker that I could trust with any kind of question, no matter how vulnerable. It means so much to me, to be able to engage in mentally stimulating and divisive topics, in such a neutral and exploratory way. It truly is rare to find someone like you, and because of this, you are a treasure to me. I'm glad you're here today to celebrate with me, because family should come together to congratulate accomplishments, and you are 100%, without a doubt, a member of my family. I love you, Julie!

Erica!

You are my go-to when I'm trying to catch up on the rest of the family. I know you never asked for that role, but dang, I appretiate you so much for being that link. You have always been the 'other Zach' in my eyes, as weird as that is. Knowledgable, infinitely approachable, a great role model, the mediator, and someone who seems to have it all figured out. There have only been a handful of recent times where we were in the same place, at the same time, but it has never detracted from the natural bond I feel towards you. Of course there are countless memories of times long-ago, Christmases and Thanksgivings were always a great time with you around. I know you were always there for assistance, opinions, gossip, and answers, should I ever be in need of any. It was a default assumption: ask Erica, and she will be there for you. And that's a little unfair. You sacrifice a lot of time, effort, and mental energy in keeping people connected and happy. You deserve the recognition and acnowledgement for that. So, thank you Erica. Some of the requirements to achieve this graduation, are unspoken and unwriten. They include having a healthy and coheisive family unit, and you have played a massive role in that. I appreciate who you are, and how much you do. Thank you a ton, for being here, and celebrating with me. I love you!

Rachel

HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! ^_^

You made it here! I'm so glad! Thank you for jumping through all the hoops to make this happen. Seriously, I'm at that point in my life where I recognize just how easy it is to forget about people who aren't immediately in your eyesight. Or how normal it is to become used to the daily grind and then whene you look up, and the entire family is 10 years older. I appretiate you for making the sacrifices it took to be here. This celebration definitely feels more complete because of your presence.

Now where are we taking this big croud of friends and family? Shall we bust down the door to Susan's place together, and have an impromptu birthday bash at her place? I'm ready if you're ready! Love ya, Rachel!

Mo!!!

Congratulations, 2024 alumni! Woo!!!! We did it!!! Thank you for being a real one. You are the EXACT kind of person I wanted to surround myself with in my college experience. Free-spirited, confident, a real stand-your-ground kind of person, who also is SO down to be involved in good times, and bad times. You trust people openly, wear your heart on your sleave, and express yourself when you want to, how you want to, %&@# what everyone else thinks. Seriously, you ROCK. I loved every single time we were involved in the same things, and I'm so happy that we were in the same group semester after semester. You have taught me to be a lot more socially aware, and that great connections can be made when everyone is just a little bit more vulnerable and open. You might have also taught me that I don't know how to deal with finalities. I can't comprehend how this might be one of the last times we share the same space. I'm certainly not ready for it, and I'm doing by best to not even acknowledge it. Please, stay in touch? And if you're planning on staying in the Sacramento area, you BETTER keep joining in on the dinners. Thank you for impacting my life so much.

Abigayle!

You are special to me. The time we spent in group feels so much longer than it actually has been. You have put forth so much effort to be a friend, a familiar face, a regular count-me-in kind of person, and as a result, you've become part of my CSUS family that I'm scared to leave. You have always cared about all of us from day 1, and you have personally trusted and taken an interest in my life that I hope you feel is reciprocated. Your honesty, welcoming nature, and openness is something that won't be forgotten, and it's something I honestly look forward to every Friday. I hope the future semesters continue being blessed by your presence.
